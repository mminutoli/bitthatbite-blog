Hello all, I’m Marco Minutoli and this is my tech blog.

I am student of computer engineering at Politecnico di Milano mostly
interested in computer architectures and compilers design and
implementation.

This blog is for all the things "learnt the hard way". It's for all
those things I don’t want to forget or I found interesting to share
with you.
